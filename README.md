### 0. Setup
Please install the packages in requirements.txt: pip install r requirements.txt

### 1. Data Extraction (if applying for a Data Engineering Position)
Run the file: Task 1 Data Extraction.py
The script will generate a log file, Task_1_Data_Extraction.log. 
This file stores the run time info and results of the validation.

### 2. Initial Data Transformation (if applying for a Data Engineering and/or Science Position)
Please from the sr.csv file into the files folder before runing script.
Run the file: Task 2 Initial Data Transformation.py
The script will generate a log file, Task_2_Initial_Data_Transformation.log, and and output file,Task_2_Initial_Data_Transformation_output. 

### 5. Further Data Transformations (if applying for a Data Engineering Position)
Please from the sr_hex.csv file into the files folder before runing script.
Run the file: Task 5 Further Data Transformations.py
The script will generate a log file, Task 5_Further_Data_Transformations.log, obfuscate_sr_hex_data.csv. 

### 6. Data Loading Tasks (if applying for a Data Engineering Position)
use Task 5 Further Data Transformations.py to generate file
Run the file: Task 6 Data Loading Tasks.py
Wrote the file to: "cct-ds-code-challenge-output-data",'NMashabaOutput.csv'
